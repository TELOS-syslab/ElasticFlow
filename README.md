# ElasticFlow-artifact

We provide the artifact for the ASPLOS 2023 paper "ElasticFlow: An Elastic Serverless Training Platform for Distributed Deep Learning", including:

- The main implementation of \sysname.
- Testbed experiment scripts (Sec 6.2 \& 6.6).
- Cluster simulator (Sec 6.3 \& 6.4 \& 6.5).

## Testbed Experiments

### General Testbed Experiments

### Testbed Experiments of Pollux
As the Pollux baseline xxx, we do not interage Pollux in the ElasticFlow system for comparison. We use the open-sourced artifact from the [Pollux repo](https://github.com/petuum/adaptdl/tree/osdi21-artifact) for testbed experiments. 

## Simulation Experiments
