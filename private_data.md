## Trace files
The job trace files are not public due to policy reasons. We will make the trace files public as soon as possible. 

The trace files include:
- `elsticVpollux_p.csv`: The trace file for pollux simulation in Figure 8(a). This file should be placed in the `<repo>/pollux/pollux_simulator/` directory.
- `pollux_testbed_trace.csv`: The trace file for pollux testbed experiment. This file should be placed in the `<repo>/pollux/pollux_testbed/` directory.
- `traces_for_ElasticFlow/`: The trace files for simulation of other schedulers in Figure 8-11. This folder should be placed in `<repo>/ElasticFlow/` directory.
