## Trace files
The job trace files are not public currently due to policy reasons. We are trying our best to make the trace files public as soon as possible. To get the traces, you need to sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with our company. Please send us your name, affiliation, and address so that we can sign NDA with you and send you the job traces privately.

The trace files include:
- `elsticVpollux_p.csv`: The trace file for pollux simulation in Figure 8(a). This file should be placed in the `<repo>/pollux/pollux_simulator/` directory.
- `pollux_testbed_trace.csv`: The trace file for pollux testbed experiment. This file should be placed in the `<repo>/pollux/pollux_testbed/` directory.
- `traces_for_ElasticFlow/`: The trace files for simulation of other schedulers in Figure 8-11. This folder should be placed in `<repo>/ElasticFlow/` directory.
