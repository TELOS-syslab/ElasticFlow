# Plotting Figures

## Contents
- `plot_figure/` contains code for simulation and is adapted from [Tiresias](https://github.com/SymbioticLab/Tiresias).
	- `logs/` is the default directory where all logs are saved. The figure plotting scripts read results from this directory by default. If you saved the logs else where, please modify the scripts.
	- `scripts/` contains the scripts for plotting the figures in our paper.

To generate the figure shown in our paper, please change the raw data in the scripts to the test results (DDL satisfactory ratio, JCT, etc.).
